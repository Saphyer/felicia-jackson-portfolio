      <p class="section-text project-text">
        There are many cloud storage products on the market right now. I was tasked as the sole UX Designer to come up
        with the
        next new thing that could offer users a different experience. The solution, a product design that addresses the
        initial
        pain points of cloud service users, and a product that can compete in an overly saturated marketplace as an MVP.

        Researching the top three competitors to discover their marketing strategies, primary audiences, and
        differentiators,
        allowed me to take a behind the scenes look into the world of cloud storage. The market is saturated with this
        type of
        product, making this concept easily duplicated. <strong>However, Apple iCloud far exceeds Google Drive and
          Dropbox in advanced
          technology. Dropbox, however, offers collaboration through different media and third-party apps. Google Drive
          starts its
          users out with a whopping 15GB of free storage.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        Pricing seems to be comparable between the three. They all share common features, a new product could definitely
        compete
        if they added certain features the others didn’t offer and kept their rates competitive.

        With the user flows finished, I started my draft content strategy document. The challenge I ran into was that, I

        point,

        I understood the premise behind the process of pulling together the “meat and potatoes” of each web page, but I
        struggled with the aspect of writing down every single word of the web page. So I pulled together the outline
        for my web
        content.

          Taking the
          time to build a strong blueprint at this juncture was key.

        After receiving feedback on the wireframes, I iterated further to make the suggested changes. I then produced a
        low
        fidelity clickable prototype. I conducted <u>usability tests</u> on three participants, two in person and one
        <u>remotely</u> to get
        their feedback. There were a few suggestions made requesting that certain things should be changed (e.g.
        information
        entered on the first signup screen should appear on the second signup screen without having to input the data a
        second
        time. It wasn’t clear if the “free plan” was actually free, etc). Overall the suggested changes to the prototype
        were
        minor. I made those changes and implemented them in the high fidelity mockups.

            level up the

            testing. I used the

            the process
            go from unrefined to this now refined prototype and were eager to get started with testing. Testing went

            Having the style guide to work with, I conducted preference tests to give me feedback on a couple of the UI
            elements
            that needed further fleshing out. I created a couple of iterations for testing. I tested the login button
            style,
            progress meter color style and the radio button style. What I learned from the participants was:

              Although 38% of people felt the login button with the stroke around it was an option, my final decision
              was to stay with
              the login button without the stroke. I did, however, change the final color on the progress meter to the
              brighter green
              color. I added in the changes recommended from the first wireframe usability testing and performed a
              second <u>usability test</u> before coming to the final version of the Hi-Fi mockups.

        my thoughts
      </h5>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        UX design has many parts and putting all those parts together to come up with a workable solution was
        challenging. <strong>I
          have grown a lot through this process and gained valuable insight into the design process.</strong> Having
        minimal
        information on
        a final product and no content presented its own set of challenges. I learned that what worked best for me was
        to knock
        it down one phase at a time and to just trust the process.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        What didn’t work was to try and have it all figured out right from the beginning. <strong>A mistake I made and
          realized
          later
          was I didn’t necessarily follow my data with regards to who my target audience should be (women).</strong> I
        wanted it to
        convey
        strength and security, but at the same time be fun and inviting. I tested my solution on more men than women,
        and
        therefore I feel the design may have taken on a more masculine feel instead of feminine. The logo is very
        masculine, but
        in my mind, I saw “strong imagery” as noted by some of my testers. The young lady I tested felt that the site
        was
        “inviting and calming”, and thought the color choice was “spot on”.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        If I had more time to work on this project I would have gotten more creative with some of the features that I
        offered in
        my solution. Data showed that some participants indicated that they would like to see newer technology used.
        <strong>Something
          critical that I found out from users is that even in this era of technology, there are still so many people
          who
          could
          care less about it and didn’t feel it was necessary for them to conduct their life functions.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        In summary, what I learned through this process was that “yes…, I can do this”. No, it’s not perfection, but
        there is
        room for growth. <strong>I believe my final solution solves user's main concern of data security by implementing
          2FA and
          adding
          more collaboration functionality.</strong> There’s much to learn to become a great UX Designer. While all
        things present
        challenges, if I don’t give up and continue to persevere, I can be successful in my endeavor. <strong>What
          surprised me
          the
          most, and what I truly didn’t understand, was the level of work it actually takes to produce an MVP.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        I will use this experience and the knowledge gained through this process to continue learning, so I can be a
        part of
        creating wonderful user experiences for future product users.

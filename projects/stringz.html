        The crafting community is large and diverse, yet there are not a lot of digital products on the market that

        trade that
        will allow crafters to better organize their projects.

        The crafting community felt like they were being left out of the tech world when it came to digital technology.

        I performed Competitive Analysis on three of the top knitting competitors on the market, Knit Companion, Love
        Knitting
        and Stash2Go. What I found most relevant was that although the various products had many offerings, none seemed
        to tap
        into the key features and concerns of the target audience.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        While they all seem to encompass similar features, <strong>Stash2Go stood out most offering direct account
          syncing with popular
          third-party website Ravelry. Knit Companion focused more on designers by providing key technical support.
          However, their
          annual rate was very expensive. Love Knitting was a free option that offered a family sharing feature that was
          popular
          with users.</strong>

          present
          themselves, (e.g., what content should flow to a separate page..., am I missing anything, etc?) I then needed

          “Message
          Friends” and “Search for Local Yarn Shop” screens in the final solution. I iterated further on the wireframes
          before
          moving on to the branding phase of the process.

          Creating the right inspiration for the brand was next on my agenda and very important to me. The colors,
          textures, and
          mood around this product would all reflect the brand’s story. A mood board was put together to help me
          visualize
          and
          bring forth my vision. Out of this inspiration, a color palette was chosen. <strong>The color palette
            represents
            the beautiful rich jewel tones of sea glass, invoking a feeling of simplicity and relaxation while knitting
            on

          I wanted to make sure the brand’s name represented the product well. It needed to be something fun and I
          wanted it to
          have a different spelling. I branded the product “Stringz”. I used a “z” instead of an “s” as sort of a play
          on words.
          Once I settled on the brand’s name, I then began the task of sketching what I wanted the logo to look like. I
          wanted it
          to be something elegant and I wanted a ball of yarn to be represented in the logo as well. I did several
          different

          During testing, Shanté brought to my attention that the “add a photo” task would serve users better if an icon
          could be
          added to show users that they could add a photo to their newly added project. On the “edit counter” task, she
          stated
          that the ellipsis icon on the homepage would be more recognizable if it were positioned horizontally instead
          of
          vertically. She also thought the “Plus and Minus” buttons on this page could be larger, this could benefit
          users with
          certain mobility issues in their hands.

          Finally, the on the “edit counter” homepage screen, Valentina suggested that I offer an empty state for first
          time
          vistors to help users understand better what can be done on this page. After all testing was completed, I went
          back to

        my thoughts
      </h5>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        Being tasked with creating a Solo Project was a big undertaking. Searching the web for ideas, it came to me to
        make a
        product around something I’m very passionate about.., Knitting and Crocheting.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        Once it was clear what direction I would take for the MVP, gathering research to find out what frustrations
        fellow
        crafters might have was key. I needed to better understand what this community felt might be lacking in the area
        of
        digital technology. As this was going to be my second time at creating a product from the ground up, I felt less
        hesitation to move forward. Taking each task one step at a time helped me keep things in a proper perspective.
        Scope
        creep is always lurking in the background for me.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        What didn’t work for me was this need to always second guess my decisions. I always feel like I’m not doing
        enough, so I
        do too much only to find out it wasn’t necessary. <strong>I need to strike the right balance and trust the
          process. If I had
          more time for this project, I would have finished designing the other screens I omitted from my final
          solution.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        What I take away from this process is that <strong>it is imperative when designing marketable solutions that the
          complexed
          nature of development should always be kept in mind when deciding what characteristics you want to showcase in
          your
          product, there may be limitations on what can be fully implemented.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="section-text project-text">
        What surprised me most with this project was just how eager users were for a product in the crafting market, and
        how my
        solution helped to address a few of those concerns. <strong>While research showed that the target audience was
          women, there is a
          niche group of men in this community and given the time I would have liked to explore that market
          further.</strong>
